        <p><em>Synopis From Back of Book</em></p>
        <p>When single mother Devon Connor hires Elvis Cole, it's because her <br> troubled teenage son Tyson is flasing cash and she's
        afraid he's dealing <br> drugs. But the truth is devastatingly different. With two others, he's been <br> responsible for a string
        of high-end buglaries, a crime spree that takes <br> a deadly turn when one of them is murdered and Tyson and his girlfriend <br>
        disappear. </p>
        <p>They stole the wrong thing from the wrong man and determined to get it back, <br> he has hired two men who are smart and brutal and the best and what they do. </p>
        <p>To even the odds, Cole brings in his friend Joe Pike, but even the two of them <br> together may be overmatched. The police don't want them anywhere near the <br>
        investigation. The teens refuse to be found, and the killers are leaving a trail <br> of bodies in their wake. Pretty soon, they'll find out everything they need to <br>
        track the kids down - and then nothing that Elvis or Joe can do may make <br> and difference. It might even get them killed. </p>
